## 5. Technical Design

### 5.1 Architecture

[Describe the overall architecture, design patterns, and key architectural decisions]

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Component A] --> B[Component B]
    B --> C[Component C]
    C --> D[Data Store]
```

**Patterns:** [e.g., Repository pattern, Observer pattern, Factory pattern]  
**Key Decisions:** [e.g., REST vs GraphQL, sync vs async processing]

### 5.2 Components and Interfaces

| Component     | Purpose        | Interface                           | Dependencies   |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [Component 1] | [What it does] | `interface Name { method(): Type }` | [Dependencies] |
| [Component 2] | [What it does] | `interface Name { method(): Type }` | [Dependencies] |

**Detailed Interfaces:**

```typescript
interface [Component1Interface] {
  method1(param: Type): ReturnType;
  method2(param: Type): ReturnType;
}

interface [Component2Interface] {
  method1(param: Type): ReturnType;
}
```

### 5.3 Data Models

```typescript
// Core data model
interface [PrimaryModel] {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  // Related fields
}

// Supporting model
interface [SecondaryModel] {
  id: string;
  [primaryModel]Id: string; // Foreign key
  // Additional fields
}
```

}
// Response:
{
  "id": "123",
  "field": "value"
